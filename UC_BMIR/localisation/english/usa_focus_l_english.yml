 USA_investments_to_aperture_desc:0 "Aperture Science is the leading private research corporation in the United States, if not the globe, striding forward in development of Quantum Ripple Technology and numerous other innovations and developments. As eccentric it’s founder, Cave Johnson, is, and as much as the reports of Highly hazardous and mildly insane working conditions, along with disregard for employee casualties concerns the Government, it is clear that Aperture Science provides disturbingly good results, on par with the Government-Controlled Black Mesa Research Facility. Providing Grants to Aperture Science could boost American technological dominance further, and shoot down the potential for Johnson to try to turn to other parties for additional funding."

In all likelihood such means of success will measure the next ushering of a technological race with our rivals who will attempt to secure the same or, perhaps, similar methodology. If quantum-leaping is able to be finalized as part of a grander scheme of infinitum-distant travel mechanisms; then even the train to even the space shuttle will be rendered practically obsolete indefinitely.

 USA_the_reckoning_desc:0 "Some time after 2000, GLaDOS tricks the Aperture Researchers on the company's first annual bring-your-cat-to-work day, requesting access to neurotoxin and various facility systems for an 'Experiment.' For some reason they believe her and grant these requests. Immediately she takes control of the facility, locks everyone inside, floods the Enrichment Center with deadly neurotoxin, and kills everyone who refuses to opt into her new testing initiative. This begins a permanent cycle of testing, aimed at beating Black Mesa in the race to develop functioning portal technology, even though Aperture has had this technology for decades.  "

From up to 5% for corporate and capital gains taxes, to significant cuts in estate taxes. Even though made feasible by his predecessor's budget surplus, an estimated 1.35 Trillion US Dollars in tax cut would significantly impact the US Economy, only made worse by Republican internal discontent and democrat opposition, as Bush pushed the limits of his presidential power to push the act into fruition.

In the United States Senate, both the Republicans, and Democrats haave 50 Seats each, an exact equilibrium. Fortunately for the Republicans, their control of the House of Representatives is quite secure, With a ten-seat majority. To secure his administration, Bush must meet with both Houses of Congress.

If they show even a hint of the internal fractures that have plagued the party for it's entire existence, it may result in the opposition gaining an advantage, consolidating and overwhelming the tiniest of cracks in the Republican facade.

 USA_black_mesa_modifier: "Black Mesa Research Facility"
 USA_black_mesa_modifier_desc: "What would become the Black Mesa Research Corporation traces its origins to the post–World War II economic boom, when a small but ambitious research firm was founded in Florida to pursue advanced aerospace and defense technologies. Its trajectory changed decisively during the Reagan administration, when a partially completed inland ICBM launch complex was abruptly cancelled after being deemed too vulnerable in the evolving strategic landscape. Backed by private capital and government interest, the company acquired the abandoned silos and subterranean caverns, expanding them into a vast underground laboratory complex and rebranding itself as the Black Mesa Research Corporation.\n\nThe facility’s early work focused on next-generation rocket propulsion and nuclear research, taking advantage of its deep, hardened infrastructure and isolation. Over the decades, its scope widened dramatically. Black Mesa established itself at the forefront of advanced materials, high-energy physics, computing, and classified defense research, while developing an intense and enduring rivalry with the equally secretive Aperture Science. Each breakthrough reinforced its reputation as a place where limits were tested and often exceeded.\n\nToday, the Black Mesa Research Facility stands as the largest single research institution on Earth and the largest building ever constructed, extending across vast underground and surface installations. It functions as a self-contained community where scientists, engineers, support staff, and their families live and work, sustained by its own infrastructure and security. The facility alone accounts for a notable share of national defense contracts and federal research funding, making it a cornerstone of American technological dominance.\n\nThat dominance is amplified by secrecy. Roughly half of the facility remains classified to varying degrees, inaccessible to the public and even to many within its own walls. Shielded from scrutiny, Black Mesa has pursued research into fields so exotic that their results strain the boundaries of accepted science. While these efforts have yielded extraordinary advances, they have also raised the possibility that the consequences of Black Mesa’s work may extend far beyond what its founders ever intended.\n\nIn time, it may be remembered not for its achievements, but for the §Runforeseen consequences§! they set in motion."
 USA_black_mesa_incident_modifier: "Black Mesa Incident"
 USA_black_mesa_incident_modifier_desc: "The Black Mesa Incident marked the moment when §Runforeseen consequences§! came to haunt the United States. A catastrophe born from decades of secret research tore through the Black Mesa Research Facility, creating a Resonance Cascade and rendering every attempt at containment futile. The complex was destroyed, its vast population of scientists and staff killed alongside the military response sent to contain the disaster. What began as an isolated disaster did not end there; the results of Black Mesa’s research spread far beyond ruins and went on to wreak havoc across the world, destabilizing regions far beyond U.S. borders and confronting humanity with threats it was unprepared to face.\n\nOnce a symbol of American technological supremacy, Black Mesa has become a warning etched into history. The facility is gone, its achievements eclipsed by the devastation it unleashed, and Black Mesa—along with the incident it spawned—now lives in infamy."

 BMI.2.d: "Forward HECU elements have touched down in the Black Mesa Research Facility, and the situation is worse than reports suggested.\n\nMuch of the facility is overrun with Xen fauna, which are universally hostile to human life. Black Mesa’s security team is overstretched attempting to coordinate their response in surface facilities, while communication with underground areas is limited or non-existent. Civilians not part of the security team have resorted to hunkering down as well as they can and awaiting rescue.\n\nMost concerningly, reports from Black Mesa staff indicate that these lifeforms ‘teleported’ in, and continue to arrive in that manner without warning. This represents an ability that current military doctrine has no answer for, which combined with the alien capabilities of Xen lifeforms have already resulted in Marine casualties.\n\nAdditionally, some members of the science team have suggested that this situation may have been caused by a so-called ‘Resonance Cascade,’ a previously theoretical quantum event that connects our universe with another. They have no idea about the consequences of this, including whether or not this connection will dissipate or otherwise solve itself over time, they can only say that this incident began around the same time that the Anomalous Materials Laboratories in Sector C was conducting a major experiment that severely taxed Black Mesa’s electrical system.\n\nRequesting further orders."
 BMI.2.a: "By god, what have they done?"
 BMI.3.t: "§OOperation Black Mesa:§! What now?"
 BMI.3.d: "The situation at Black Mesa is worse than we could have ever feared. The facility is overrun with alien lifeforms, countless scientists and civilians unaware of just how deep Black Mesa’s research went have been exposed to the truth, and our soldiers who have yet to be trained for braving the dangers of Xen are already dying to its creatures.\n\nClearly, we need to come down with the full strength we can muster, the HECU will be deployed in its entirety, while other units will hold an exclusion zone around the facility while the HECU cleans up.\n\nHowever, there is the question of what to do with the civilians at Black Mesa, and the rest of the staff as well. All of them have now been exposed to the truth in the worst way possible, and even though they don’t have the entire truth, many of them are smart enough to work it out. This poses a massive security risk, with the potential of leaks giving our adversaries the chance to begin their own research into teleportation and Xen. Additionally, there is the potential that this incident began as an act of sabotage, to weaken America and cripple our research capabilities to even the playing field.\n\nSo the question is, §Rdo we silence the witnesses?§!"
 BMI.3.a: "No one can know what happened at Black Mesa."
 BMI.4.t: "§OOperation Black Mesa:§! Where to focus?"
 BMI.4.d: "The officer in charge of the operation clearly wasn’t pleased to hear the order, but confirmed his receipt of it, and that it would be carried out.\n\nNow, while the HECU is moving to secure the entirety of the facility, there are a couple of key locations of interest.\n\nFirst, is the Lambda Labs. These are the primary teleportation labs of Black Mesa, and where the finest minds who would be best suited to answer questions regarding how to close this multi-universal connection. It’s also the most sensitive location to national security in the facility, and if there are any spies or saboteurs present, it would be a priority target for them.\n\nSecond is Sector C, Anomalous Materials. According to what we know, the incident was either caused there, or was the epicenter of it. Either way, the automated systems there should have recorded some additional information on what happened and why, more than enough to make sure this doesn’t happen again, as well as pointing towards a §Rsuitable scapegoat.§!"
 BMI.4.a: "Lambda Labs"
 BMI.4.b: "Sector C"
 BMI.5.t: "An Admin's Rescue"
 BMI.5.d: "Dr. Wallace Breen wasn’t sure how everything had come crumbling down like this. He had spent decades climbing the scientific world until he stood as Administrator of the world’s foremost scientific institutions. He had led entire teams of scientists to make some of the most incredible breakthroughs in human history. He had the ear of no small number of people in Washington, who all made sure Black Mesa wanted for nothing in its pursuit of scientific greatness.\n\nYet, as he sat in his office, it was clear that everything had gone wrong.\n\nHe was well aware of what a Resonance Cascade was, so was the entire team at the Lambda Labs. A hypothetical event that while proven possible by math, was believed to be so unlikely as to be effectively impossible. A none zero event, as it was called. Similar to the idea that the Trinity Test would ignite Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nAnd yet, here he was. Hiding in his office, his large expensive desk propped up against a door that §Rsomething§! was banging on, hoping that someone would come save him before the door broke, or §Rsomething else§! teleported straight in and killed him instead.\n\nHe felt no relief at the intermittent gunfire in the distance, assuming it to be the overwhelmed security team going down fighting. Only when the gunfire got closer, and whatever was at the door lost interest in getting to him in favor of that gunfire, did he dare to hope.\n\nFinally, there was a short burst of gunfire just outside his office, and he heard a voice. “Administrator Breen, are you in there?” Shouted a gruff voice.\n\nBreen let out a deep sigh of relief, shouting that yes, he was indeed inside, and moved to unblock the door.\n\nThe very moment he did, the door slammed open and multiple soldiers filed in and surrounded him. They grabbed hold, forced his hands behind his back, and zip tied them tight. Breen barely had a moment to process what was going on and to ask why he was being detained like this, he heard one of the soldiers speak into his radio."
 BMI.5.a: "\"Administrator Breen in custody.\""
 BMI.6.t: "§OOperation Black Mesa:§! High Priority Target"
 BMI.6.d: "As operations in Black Mesa are ongoing, one individual has emerged as a particular threat to our objectives in the facility. One Dr Gordon Freeman, a member of Black Mesa’s Science Team has proven adept at engaging and defeating Marines of the HECU, with dozens of Marines KIA at his hands thus far.\n\nDr Freeman has demonstrated an unusual level of skill in the handling and use of a variety of firearms, and is equipped with Black Mesa’s Hazardous Environment Suit, complete with high impact reactive armor and on board medical capabilities. This stands in contrast to the Powered Combat Vest in use by the HECU, which was believed to be more maneuverable compared to the HEV Suit, but instead has proven simply inferior as Dr Freeman has displayed no difficulty in maneuver while in combat with the HECU.\n\nIt is recommended that the FBI begin an immediate probe into Dr Freeman’s identity and history, for possible foreign links, manufactured identity, or any other indicators of foreign espionage.\n\nAdditionally, reinforcements are requested at Black Mesa, as Dr Freeman’s actions combined with increasing Xen hostility have left the HECU struggling to contain the situation in the many underground sections of Black Mesa."
 BMI.6.a: "Perhaps this is the spy we've been worried about"
 BMI.7.t: "§OOperation Black Mesa:§! Freeman Launches Rocket"
 BMI.7.d: "HVT Freeman entered into the launch site for an unmanned satellite, engaged multiple HECU squads, leaving all Marines involved KIA, and seized control of the site. Before reinforcements could arrive, Freeman activated the launch sequence, sending the satellite into orbit, and vacating the site before HECU reinforcements could engage him.\n\nUnfortunately, NASA detected this launch, and in keeping with standard procedure, publicly announced this before we could inform them of the need for discretion. The world is now aware of the rocket launch, and questions are being raised regarding what is going on at Black Mesa. The cover story is holding for now, but serious questions are being raised regarding the possibility of maintaining it long term."
 BMI.7.a: "This is going to be tricky to explain..."
 BMI.8.t: "§OOperation Black Mesa:§! Signs of Organized Invasion"
 BMI.8.d: "The HECU reports that the situation at Black Mesa is escalating.\n\nPreviously, Xen lifeforms in Black Mesa displayed simple behavior expected of animals suddenly teleported from their habitat into a completely foreign one. While exceptionally dangerous, even to the highly trained Marines of the HECU, they could still be dispatched with simple tactics and caution.\n\nThat has changed. Now, increasingly numbers of some Zen lifeforms are appearing, and they are displaying squad level tactics, organizing ambushes, and even appear to be coordinating teleportation events to take HECU units off guard. Most notably, they have suddenly appeared to ambush field hospitals and equipment dumps, causing grievous casualties.\n\nWe may not be looking at a simple disaster and cleanup, we may in fact be looking at an organized invasion effort by an alien race."
 BMI.8.a: "This is getting worse by the hour."
 BMI.9.t: "§OOperation Black Mesa:§! Lambda Labs Fortified"
 BMI.9.d: "Facing increasingly heavy resistance by Xen forces, HECU have managed to reach the Lambda Labs. Unfortunately, the Science Team there have managed to seal off and lock down all entrances, barricading themselves within. While the HECU would be more than capable of breaching and clearing these areas under normal circumstances, Xen pressure forced the Marines back, with the commander in charge of the operation reporting that his full attention is now on defending what they still control topside of Black Mesa.\n\nWhatever we could have learned in the Lambda Labs is now lost to us."
 BMI.9.a: "Damn."
 BMI.10.t: "§OOperation Black Mesa:§! Sector C Reached"
 BMI.10.d: "Despite increasingly heavy resistance by Xen forces across the facility, Marines accessing Sector C had a comparatively easy time. Instead of the organized aliens found elsewhere, Sector C was primarily overrun with animal life from Xen, primarily the so-called “headcrabs” and the “zombies” they create.\n\nThe squads sent to Sector C managed to acquire multiple damaged hard drives and boxes of documents from Sector C before pulling out, and already priority orders have been issued to extract this intel from Black Mesa and move it to Washington for analysis.\n\nWhile it seems increasingly unlikely we will contain this disaster, we will at least know who to blame for it.\n\n§RWhether they deserve it or not.§!"
 BMI.10.a: "At least something went our way"
 BMI.11.t: "§OOperation Black Mesa:§! Situation Critical"
 BMI.11.d: "The situation at Black Mesa has become untenable.\n\nThe HECU has taken extreme casualties attempting to defend the few parts of Black Mesa they still hold, with most of their units rendered combat ineffective while still being in the midst of heavy combat. Morale is low, and it is likely that only the remoteness of the BMRF has prevented desertion or mutiny at this point.\n\nMeanwhile, Xen forces continue to pour in, as well as continue to escalate. They have deployed air units that have now contested the sky above Black Mesa, hampering Close Air Support, as well as beginning CAS runs on the HECU. What appear to be frontline Xen troops have arrived in numbers and have proven to be more than a match for a human, even one as well trained as a US Marine.\n\nThe commander of the operation has officially requested permission to retreat, though the way he said it, he is probably going to pull out regardless of our orders, and is merely seeing if we would force him to disobey them."
 BMI.11.a: "\"...Pull out. Save what you can.\""
 BMI.12.t: "\"Forget about Freeman!\""
 BMI.12.d: "“Forget about Freeman, we are cutting our losses and pulling out!”\n\nFor Corporal Robert Jacobs, those words were the best news he heard all day. Best news since being deployed to this hellhole even. The lieutenant's words about making it to an LZ and not wanting to walk home in ‘this weather’ may as well have not existed compared to how he felt hearing that they were finally leaving.\n\nTheir unit quickly gathered into an impromptu convoy surrounding their Abrams and LAVs, the latter of which carried their wounded as they began heading for the nearest LZ. For once, the monsters they were fighting didn’t even resist their movement that much, and they made quick time.\n\nWhen one of those flying Manta Ray things flew overhead, a glowing light in its belly suddenly shooting down and vaporizing the front of their convoy, Jacobs froze up, with only one thought going through his head."
 BMI.12.a: "\"That's just not fair.\""
 BMI.13.t: "§OOperation Black Mesa:§! Final Solution"
 BMI.13.d: "We’ve evacuated everyone we can before the LZs were overrun. Now, all that remains are our Tier 1 operators entrusted with one more mission, one of critical importance.\n\nThe deployment and detonation of a nuclear weapon in the heart of Black Mesa.\n\nWe hoped it wouldn’t come to this. Detonating a nuke on American soil is far too big to cover up, and will certainly stain this administration, perhaps even this whole government, for generations. But it's our last option. Alien forces have established a foothold in Black Mesa, and there are even reports of teleportation events occurring elsewhere in New Mexico, with the lifeforms deposited there being engaged by the National Guard.\n\nWe can only hope that this will stop the situation from getting any worse."
 BMI.13.a: "God bless the United States of America."
 BMI_news.1.t: "Minor Nuclear Accident Reported at Black Mesa"
 BMI_news.1.d: "Federal and state authorities confirmed today that a minor nuclear accident occurred earlier this morning at the Black Mesa Research Facility, a large government-contracted laboratory located in a remote desert region of the American Southwest.\n\nAs a precaution, authorities have established a temporary exclusion zone extending 75 miles in all directions from the facility. Civilian access to the area has been suspended, airspace restrictions are in effect, and nearby highways have been closed. Residents within the affected region are being advised to remain indoors until further notice or to comply with evacuation orders where issued.\n\nEmergency response teams, including federal hazardous materials units and military support elements, have been deployed to secure the site and assess the situation. Officials stated that containment measures are underway and that there is currently no confirmed evidence of widespread contamination beyond the facility grounds.\n\nThe Black Mesa Research Facility has long operated under strict secrecy due to the sensitive nature of its work. As a result, officials declined to provide specific details regarding the experiment involved, citing national security concerns.\n\nFurther updates are expected as investigators determine the full scope of the incident and its potential long-term consequences."

 BMI_news.2.t: "Exclusion Zone Around Black Mesa Expanded to 150 Miles"
 BMI_news.2.d: "Federal authorities announced today that the exclusion zone surrounding the Black Mesa Research Facility has been expanded from 75 miles to 150 miles, citing worsening conditions at the site of yesterday’s reported nuclear accident.\n\nAlongside the expansion, mandatory evacuation orders have been issued for all residents within the newly designated zone. State and federal officials confirmed that the decision was made after continued abnormal radiation readings and the failure of initial containment efforts to stabilize the situation.\n\nThe Department of Energy stated that conditions inside the facility remain unstable and that ongoing monitoring indicates a growing risk of environmental contamination. While officials declined to specify the nature of the escalation, they emphasized that the expanded zone is a preventative measure intended to protect civilian lives.\n\nNational Guard units have been mobilized to assist with evacuations, enforce access restrictions, and support emergency services. Major transportation routes leading away from the area are now under military and law enforcement control, and emergency shelters are being established in neighboring states to accommodate displaced residents.\n\nAirspace over the region remains closed, and all non-essential communications infrastructure within the exclusion zone has been shut down. Officials warned that unauthorized entry into the area will be treated as a federal offense.\n\nGovernment representatives acknowledged growing public concern and stated that additional information will be released as soon as it is cleared for public disclosure. For now, authorities maintain that full compliance with evacuation orders is critical as the situation at Black Mesa continues to develop."

 BMI_news.3.d: "The federal government announced today that a previously undisclosed hostile force is now confirmed to be present at the Black Mesa Research Facility, marking a dramatic escalation in the ongoing crisis.\n\nIn an address from the White House, the President declared a national state of emergency, citing an immediate and severe threat to public safety and national security. The President ordered all remaining ground forces to withdraw from the Black Mesa area and authorized the commencement of airstrikes over the facility and its surrounding zone.\n\nSenior defense officials stated that the hostile force was identified following repeated breakdowns in containment efforts and a series of violent engagements within the exclusion zone. While no details were provided regarding the origin or nature of the threat, officials described it as “active, coordinated, and highly dangerous.”\n\nAt the same time, evacuation orders have been expanded to include the entirety of the state of New Mexico. Residents are being instructed to leave the state as quickly as possible using designated evacuation corridors. Interstate highways are now under federal control, and emergency shelters are being established across neighboring states to receive evacuees.\n\nScattered reports have emerged of National Guard units engaging unknown hostiles at multiple locations within the state. These encounters have not been independently confirmed, but officials acknowledged that Guard forces were responding to “localized security incidents” during evacuation operations.\n\nAll airspace over New Mexico has been closed, civilian communications are being restricted in several regions, and the Pentagon confirmed that additional air assets are being deployed to the area.\n\nGovernment officials urged the public to remain calm and to follow evacuation orders without delay, stating that the situation remains fluid and that further announcements will be made as events continue to unfold."

 BMI_news.4.t: "Nuclear Detonation Reported at Black Mesa!"
 BMI_news.4.d: "A nuclear weapon detonation was reported earlier today at the site of the Black Mesa Research Facility, according to seismic data, satellite observations, and independent monitoring agencies. Despite mounting evidence, the federal government has issued no formal confirmation or explanation regarding the event.\n\nMultiple seismic monitoring stations across the continental United States recorded a powerful underground shock originating from the Black Mesa exclusion zone shortly before dawn. Satellite imagery analyzed by private firms appears to show a brief but intense thermal flash followed by a rapidly expanding cloud over the area where the facility once stood.\n\nIn the hours following the apparent detonation, federal agencies fell largely silent. Scheduled press briefings were abruptly canceled, and no senior officials have appeared publicly to address the incident. Requests for comment from the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the White House have gone unanswered.\n\nEmergency alert systems in neighboring states issued vague advisories urging residents to avoid travel toward the Southwest, but provided no reference to a nuclear event. Airspace over a wide region remains closed, and military aircraft activity has increased along the perimeter of the former exclusion zone.\n\nIndependent experts note that the detected yield appears consistent with a low- to moderate-yield nuclear weapon. The absence of official statements has fueled widespread concern and speculation regarding the purpose of the strike and the conditions that led to its use.\n\nWith New Mexico already under evacuation orders and communications from the affected region severely limited, reliable information remains scarce. As of this writing, the federal government has neither acknowledged the detonation nor provided guidance on potential environmental or long-term consequences."

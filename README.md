# Unforeseen-Consequences-Black-Mesa-Incident-Revamped
A basic submod for Unforeseen Consequences, adding an event chain with dynamic modifiers to the Black Mesa Incident. An example for my application to join the dev team of Unforeseen Consequences.

Honestly, I would be turning this into a near full revamp of the pre incident, pre war US if I had the time. Add to the fact that all of this so far is probably rendered obsolete by the next update for the mod, and I didn't want to spend any more time on it then I had already. So this isn't a demonstration of a full submod by me, but instead a demonstration that I do know what I'm doing when it comes to coding in Hoi4, and am at least competent in the fields of writing and designing event chains.
